# Strict Golang Coding Rules for This Project Structure

1. **Dependency Injection**:  
   - All application dependencies (repositories, managers, queues, etc.) MUST be instantiated and injected ONLY in `app/app.go`.  
   - No package, except for the application bootstrap (`app/app.go`), may directly construct or initialize dependencies outside this central location.

2. **Domain Layer Isolation**:  
   - Only the `domain/entities` package may contain domain types (entities, structs, error definitions).  
   - No other package may define business/domain entities, except those placed within `domain/entities/`.
   - All data objects (e.g., `SessionData`, `TokenUsage`, `ProxyRequest`, `ProxyResponse`, errors) MUST be defined exclusively in `domain/entities/`.

3. **Interface-Based Dependency Management**:  
   - All external or internal dependencies between packages (e.g., session storage, queues, handlers) MUST be expressed via interfaces.
   - Concrete implementations (e.g., memory/SQLite repositories, managers, queues) MUST satisfy interfaces and be injected via constructors.

4. **No Circular Dependencies**:  
   - The `domain` package MUST NOT import from or depend on any internal, application, or infrastructure code.
   - Internal packages (`internal/...`) may depend on domain entities and interfaces, but NEVER the reverse.

5. **Handler Construction**:  
   - HTTP handlers MUST be constructed via exported constructors (`NewHandlerType(...)`) that accept interfaces for all dependencies.
   - Handlers MUST NOT access global state or singletons; use only injected dependencies.

6. **Extensibility and Isolation**:  
   - To add new storage or integration types, implement the relevant interface in a new file under `internal/repository/` and register it for construction via configuration in `app.go`.

7. **Handlers are part of the Presentation Layer**.
   - They accept incoming requests (HTTP, gRPC, GraphQL — it doesn't matter).
   - They decode the request (for example: json.Unmarshal, proto.Unmarshal).
   - They validate the request (sometimes at this level, sometimes through middleware).
   - They call the business logic (use case).
   - They receive the result and return a response (HTTP Response, gRPC Response, etc.).
   - There should be NO business logic in Handlers!
